The world was on fire, no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like u
And i never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you 

No, I don't wanna fall in love with you(this world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love with you(this world is only gonna break your heart)
